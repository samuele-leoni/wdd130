            <h2>Samuele Giovanni Leoni</h2>
            Hello everyone! My name is Samuele Leoni, I'm 25 years old and live in Milan, Italy.
            I love technology since I was a child, it's something I inherited from my father, he also is kind of a tech
            enthusiast.
            My hobbies are reading manga, playing videogames with friends and family, listening to music and watching
            movies/series.
            I also enjoy playing guitar from time to time.
            I currently work as a software developer at a small company who creates and produces a variety of industrial
            sensors.
            Although I love my job I would like to do some experience abroad and that's also another reason why I am
            pursuing my education here at BYU-Idaho Online.
            About what I love about this program is that I can still pursue my education while working full-time which
            is
            the
            most important thing for me because otherwise I couldn't afford studying.
            I really love the Hymn "Come, Come, Ye Saints" it always give me strength and courage to persevere and
            follow
            my
            dreams.
            Thank you for reading my little introduction to myself I hope to know you all better and that we can
            successfully
            overcome every difficulty we may find in this or in future courses but also in our whole lives.
