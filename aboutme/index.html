        <h2>Samuele Giovanni Leoni</h2>
        <p>
            <p>Hello everyone! My name is Samuele Leoni, I'm 25 years old and live in Milan, Italy.</p>
            <p>I love technology since I was a child, it's something I inherited from my father, he also is kind of a tech enthusiast.
            My hobbies are reading manga, playing videogames with friends and family, listening to music and watching movies/series.
            I also enjoy playing guitar from time to time.</p>
            <p>I currently work as a software developer at a small company who creates and produces a variety of industrial sensors.
            Although I love my job I would like to do some experience abroad and that's also another reason why I am pursuing my education here at BYU-Idaho Online.</p>
            <p>About what I love about this program is that I can still pursue my education while working full-time which is the most important thing for me because otherwise I couldn't afford studying.</p>
            <p>I really love the Hymn "Come, Come, Ye Saints" it always give me strength and courage to persevere and follow my dreams.</p>
            <p>Thank you for reading my little introduction to myself I hope to know you all better and that we can successfully overcome every difficulty we may find in this or in future courses but also in our whole lives.</p>
