                <h2>Do I/we need to buy some kind of equipement or is it included?</h2>
                There is the possibility to bring your own equipement although if that's not possible we offer ours charging a small insurance and cleaning fee.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Do I/we need a particular training or to be in particular physical conditions?</h2>
                No, you don't need any particular training, although we offer the possibility of a class with an expert instructor who will also give practical demonstrations. Regarding instead the physical conditions, you need to be visited by a physician in advance in order to participate and you must also compile a module where you declare that you are in good health.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Is it a risky activity?</h2>
                It depends, likewise all things it can be dangerous if done recklessly. Anyway, our equipement is 100% safe and checked every time before we give it to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Can anybody participate?</h2>
                Yes, everyone is welcome to participate. Of course there are some restrictions: children have to be with an adult and must be more than 8 years old; groups must book beforehand.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Is there any price reduction for groups?</h2>
                There is, we will consider every request and send the discounted price to the email used to contact us. We would like to add that schools, as well as companies, can have a special discount for multiple bookings, but in order to do that they have to contact us to stipulate a contract that will define the clauses.
